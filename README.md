# Remembering_Names

This project was made in line with a Makers Academy Workshop.

The aim of the workshop is to develop and practice TDD skills, taking a User Story and turning this into a Domain Model to test drive.

The expectation is to create tests for remembering names using add and display methods.

To use this, clone the repository and run in terminal using irb.
